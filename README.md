# What's New?

## Description
What's New is a React based news app that displays news articles pulled from an API. The app includes a menu to toggle through the different categories of news articles.

Learning goals for this project include:
* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Learn to pass information between components using props.
* Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
* Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
